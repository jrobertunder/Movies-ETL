# Movies-ETL
Extracting, transforming, and loading three databases of movie data 
As chaotic and messy as this unit is it shows just how messy the real world of data is.
It is clear from all the work needed that it was necessary to eliminate as much as it was to condense and clean the data.
While there is still a virtual mountian of data remaining it is possible that through the ETL process a resonable database of information might emerge.
